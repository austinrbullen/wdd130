<p>I am working on a major in Computer Science with a minor in Mandarin. 
    I am also wrapping up on my PPL (Private Pilot License) </p>
<p>I love travelling around the world, learning languages, learning history, 
    flying planes, and Formula 1!</p>
<p>I have been married for almost a year now to my beautiful wife Macee</p>
<p>I think it's always good to see what paths you can take, sometimes you 
never know what kind of jobs that are available to you, such as with 
web design or development. Jobs I never thought of looking into but 
were exposed to thanks to this class. For me, I am taking this class 
to take a look at all avenues I can take in the tech world, just
looking for things that I might be interested in. Either way making
websites would be a cool skill to have.</p>
<p>I have been a member for all my life, but swayed off the path for a
short while but came back, and served a full time mission in Bueno Aires
Argentina, on the west side. I'd say my favorite scripture is Alma 61:13
"But behold he doth not command us that we shall subject ourselves to 
our enemies, but we should put our trust in him, and he will deliver us"
I read this scripture when I found out my mom had been diagnosed with
cancer while on my mission. It really helped my process that news and 
accept that whatever happened, I needed to be where I was.</p>
